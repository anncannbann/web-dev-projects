# project 1: Expanding Cards
In this project, we're styling these panels to have a bg image and a heading and using flexbox to align everything.I have chosen 5 shows that i like as an example. Using js we have to change the class to active and then expanding it using css transisition.Using js using for event listener, css trsnsition for smooth effect. Heading doesnt come in untill the card is fully expanded.
